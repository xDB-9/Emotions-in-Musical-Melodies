# Project Repository

This repository will contain **ALL** the code, analysis, document and presentation for your group project.
 
For running the shiny app (without any analysis at your end), you may want to download the .RData file which has the title - **MTH208-Grp-Project.RData** in the `Data` section.
It has all data which has been scraped followed by pre-processing and finally all the analysis which had to be done.

If all the code needs to be run at local end, then follow the following order - 
1) All the code in the `Webscraping` (order doesn't matter).
2) In the `Analysis` folder given in the main- kindly run `Pre-Processing` first followed by all the other three folders in any order.
3) Then you you may want to run the `plots` folder in any order as you please. 
4) Finally the `ShinyApp` folder and you will have an option to run three apps, so kindly choose which one you may want to work and run that accordingly.

`Presentation` section contains the .pptx file which was presented.
`Documentation` section contains the .RMD file and the .pdf file for the report which had to be uploaded.

All the other .MD files in the main contains information on how to understand the data.

Truly,
Group 15
